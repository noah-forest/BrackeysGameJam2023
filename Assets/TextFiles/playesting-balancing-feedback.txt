shoctovel needs higher dig count

-- playtesting feedback --
dig count should not get higher when leveling?
find a way to fix the spin cycle
pay to reveal needs to be more clear?
enemy scaling could be clearer (maybe full screen UI animation? after win)
unit preview works, and makes the game a bit more fun
wants to keep playing, and wants to get other characters but they seem too rare
did not like how much you have to dig
felt that they couldn't tell what was going on because they were too focused on reviving units
